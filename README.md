# Exploring the blockchain

This repository contains a simple yet functional blockchain implementation written in Python. It serves as a practical sandbox to help me understand the inner workings of blockchain technology and smart contracts, which I'm learning with the help of some courses.

## What's in the repository?

- A fully functional blockchain created from scratch.
- Mining mechanism using Proof of Work (PoW).
- Flask-based REST API with two main endpoints:
  - `/mine_block`: mines a new block.
  - `/get_chain`: returns the full blockchain.


## Why this project?

In recent years, my curiosity about cryptocurrencies and their market has grown significantly. To avoid relying my investments solely on technical analysis of price charts and to become more familiar with the underlying technologies, I decided to take a mini-course to deepen my knowledge of the technologies that power cryptocurrencies.
